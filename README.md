# Quantum-Archaeology-Egypt
Quantum ML model to predict archaeology scores in Egypt
 Quantum Archaeology: Predicting the Past with Future Tech
 TEAM 8

In this project, we explore a bold intersection between ancient Egyptian archaeology and quantum machine learning.

Using a real-world dataset of 500 archaeological sites across Egypt — enriched with features like location, looting risk, material composition, and climate impact — we designed a quantum regression model to predict an AI Prediction Score for each site.

Our goal?
To help prioritize excavation efforts, protect cultural heritage, and bring quantum intelligence into historical preservation.

What I Did?

Preprocessed archaeological data with scikit-learn

Built a Quantum Neural Network using Qiskit and EstimatorQNN

Designed a variational quantum circuit 

Trained with SPSA optimizer and compared it to Random Forest

Evaluated both models using RMSE, MAE, and R²

Visualized results and residuals to understand performance



⚙ Tech Stack

Qiskit, Qiskit Machine Learning, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

💡 Why This Matters

This project is a proof-of-concept that quantum machine learning can be applied to real, culturally relevant problems — even with limited qubits and hybrid models.

It’s not just a model. It’s a step toward using the technology of tomorrow to protect the treasures of the past.
